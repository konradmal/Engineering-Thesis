# Modular Arithmetic Learning Support Application

## Overview

This project aims to facilitate the learning of modular arithmetic for first-year computer science students. It is a web application designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide an interactive learning experience. The application covers various topics in modular arithmetic, offering theoretical explanations followed by practical, algorithm-based exercises.

## Features

- **Interactive Learning Modules:** Each topic is introduced with a theoretical background, followed by exercises categorized into basic and advanced levels.
- **Algorithm Implementations:** Includes JavaScript implementations for generating random numbers, prime numbers, calculating GCD using Euclid's algorithm, and more.
- **User-friendly Interface:** Designed to be intuitive and aesthetically pleasing, ensuring compatibility across devices.

## Getting Started

To run the application locally:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Structure

The application is structured into multiple HTML and JavaScript files, each serving a specific function, ranging from presenting theoretical content to managing exercise submissions and user interactions.
