# Modular Arithmetic Learning Support Application

## Overview

This project aims to facilitate the learning of modular arithmetic for first-year computer science students. It is a web application designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide an interactive learning experience. The application covers various topics in modular arithmetic, offering theoretical explanations followed by practical, algorithm-based exercises.

## Abstract

The goal of this application is to provide educational support to first-year computer science students in modular arithmetic. It has been designed using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript technologies, ensuring compatibility with both mobile and stationary devices. The application features an intuitive and aesthetically pleasing user interface. Created for educational purposes, it covers eight diverse topics, each corresponding to a different issue discussed in Discrete Mathematics 2 classes for computer science at the Faculty of Applied Informatics and Mathematics of the Warsaw University of Life Sciences. Each topic starts with a detailed explanation of theoretical foundations, illustrated with a specific example. After familiarizing themselves with the theory, users can test their knowledge by solving basic or advanced level exercises. The user's inputs are then verified by the application, allowing for immediate feedback on their accuracy.

## Features
